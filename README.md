VelocityFoundation is a library for fast development of Velocity plugins.

## Why use VelocityFoundation?

* Syntax and classes similar to Bukkit/BungeeCord to help you transition over to Velocity.
* Focus on simplicity to avoid over-the-top abstractions and complicated names.
* A simpler command system.
* A ton of time-saving methods useful for people tired of dealing with abstract/complicated APIs (i.e. Common#tell(Player, String for simple player messaging without the need to use Adventure each time)

## Usage

1. Include [VelocityFoundation]([url](https://jitpack.io/#kangarko/VelocityFoundation)) to your Maven/Gradle dependency from our JitPack.
```xml
<repositories>
  <repository>
    <id>jitpack.io</id>
    <url>https://jitpack.io</url>
  </repository>
</repositories>
```
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.kangarko</groupId>
    <artifactId>VelocityFoundation</artifactId>
    <version>REPLACE_WITH_VERSION</version>
</dependency>
 ```
2. Include [velocity-api]([url](https://docs.papermc.io/velocity/dev/creating-your-first-plugin#setting-up-the-dependency)) and [lombok]([url](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.projectlombok/lombok)) to your dependencies.

 ```xml
<dependency>
	<groupId>com.velocitypowered</groupId>
	<artifactId>velocity-api</artifactId>
	<version>3.3.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
	<scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
<dependency>
	<groupId>org.projectlombok</groupId>
	<artifactId>lombok</artifactId>
	<version>1.18.32</version>
	<scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
 ```

3. Relocate VelocityControl and its library nashorn. Here is a snippet for Maven to place inside <plugins> section. You need to change the shadedPattern to match your own package name.

```xml
<plugin>
  <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
  <artifactId>maven-shade-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>3.5.1</version>
  <executions>
    <execution>
      <phase>package</phase>
      <goals>
        <goal>shade</goal>
      </goals>
    </execution>
  </executions>
  <configuration>
    <createDependencyReducedPom>false</createDependencyReducedPom>
    <relocations>
      <relocation>
        <pattern>org.mineacademy.vfo</pattern>
        <shadedPattern>org.mineacademy.velocitycontrol.lib</shadedPattern>
      </relocation>
      <relocation>
        <pattern>org.objectweb.asm</pattern>
        <shadedPattern>org.mineacademy.velocitycontrol.nashorn.asm</shadedPattern>
      </relocation>
    </relocations>
  </configuration>
</plugin>
```

4. Make your main plugin class override SimplePlugin and implement the necessary constructor. See the example below for an empty main plugin's class (make sure to change @Plugin info to match your own info).

```java
package org.mineacademy.chatsync;

import java.nio.file.Path;

import org.mineacademy.velocitycontrol.listener.ChatListener;
import org.mineacademy.vfo.command.ReloadCommand;
import org.mineacademy.vfo.plugin.SimplePlugin;
import org.slf4j.Logger;

import com.google.inject.Inject;
import com.velocitypowered.api.plugin.Plugin;
import com.velocitypowered.api.plugin.annotation.DataDirectory;
import com.velocitypowered.api.proxy.ProxyServer;

@Plugin(id = "chatsync", name = "ChatSync", version = "1.0.0", authors = { "kangarko" })
public final class ChatSyncPlugin extends SimplePlugin {

	@Inject
	public ChatSyncPlugin(final ProxyServer proxyServer, Logger logger, final @DataDirectory Path dataDirectory) {
		super(proxyServer, logger, dataDirectory);
	}

	// This method is called on server start
	@Override
	protected void onPluginStart() {
	}

	// This method is called on server stop
	@Override
	protected void onPluginStop() {
	}

	// This method is called on /chatreload and on the plugin startup, place your event, command and runnable registration here
	@Override
	protected void onReloadablesStart() {
		//this.registerEvents(new ChatListener());
		//this.registerCommand(new ReloadCommand("chatreload", "chatcontrol.command.reload"));
	}
}

```
